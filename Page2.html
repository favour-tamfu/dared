          <h1>Commemorating World Heritage Day</h1>
          <p>
            An amazing experience on the first day of community activities for
            the celebration of the International Day for Monuments and Sites.
            Commemorative activities began at 9:00 a.m. with a visit to the CRTV
            radio regional station for the program "Yours and Mine." On this
            program, we spoke about the historical significance of World
            Heritage Day, telling the audience about its history and conception,
            and also the cultural significance of this day within our local
            context. We talked about the heritage sites within the northwest
            region of Cameroon, also giving them a rundown of the importance of
            protecting these sites and some of the activities that have been
            carried out to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next on our program was a visit to a series of heritage sites within
            the region with students from the University of Bamenda's Faculty of
            History and Archaeology. On this visit, we started at the German
            fort, where we showed students buildings over 112 years old, also
            showing them the graveyard on the fort where German and British
            soldiers were buried in Cameroon. Next up was a visit to Menteh
            village, a village that holds one of the most prestigious heritage
            sites within the region: the Menteh Waterfall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon arrival at the village, we were taken to the house of the
            sub-chief, also known as "MOOH." At his house, he welcomed the
            entourage, giving us a brief history about the village, the
            festivals carried out there, and some historical practices. In a
            question-and-answer session, students were able to learn about the
            cultural significance of the Menteh waterfall and also some
            practices that were significant to the cultural values, such as the
            annual festivals where water is carried from the falls to the Fon of
            the villages to be used for the year. Next up was a visit to the
            site by the entourage, led by the MOOH and some elders of Menteh
            village.
