              Engaging craft men and women in the Northwest Region as a tool for
              capacity building through roundtable discussions to identify key
              areas for intervention and support to creative and Cultural
              sectors. As a means to supporting import substitution as part of
              government efforts to build local economies, engaging SMEs CIGs
              and cooperative societies to partner, network and collaborate in
              building lasting partnership that can help build the sector,
              increase ROI and local development.
